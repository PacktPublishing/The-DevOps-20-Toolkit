#The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit
This is the code repository for [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/devops-20-toolkit?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785289194), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d \
'{"_id": 1,
"title": "My First Book",
"author": "John Doe",
"description": "Not a very good book"}' \
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/books | jq '.'
```

This book is about different techniques that help us architect software in a better 
and more efficient way with microservicespacked as immutable containers, testedand 
deployed continuouslyto servers that are automatically provisionedwith configuration 
managementtools. It’s about fast, reliable and continuous deployments with zerodowntimeand ability to roll-back. It’s about scalingto any number of servers, design of 
self-healing systemscapable of recuperation from both hardware and software failures 
and about centralized logging and monitoringof the cluster.
In other words, this book envelops the whole microservices development and 
deployment lifecycle using some of the latest and greatest practices and tools. We’ll 
use Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Ubuntu, Docker Swarm and Docker Compose, 
Consul, etcd, Registrator, confd, Jenkins, and so on. We’ll go through many practices 
and, even more, tools.
Finally, while there will be a lot of theory, this is a hands-on book. You won’t be able 
to complete it by reading it in a metro on a way to work. You’ll have to read this 
book while in front of a computer getting your hands dirty. Eventually, you might 
get stuck and in need of help. Or you might want to write a review or comment 
on the book’s content. Please post your thoughts on the The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit 
channel in Disqus. If you prefer one-on-one discussion, feel free to send me an email 
to viktor@farcic.com, or to contact me on HangOuts, and I’ll give my best to help 
you out.
